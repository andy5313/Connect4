# Getting Started with Create React App

Connet-4 App Built With React and Typescript!

The rules of the game are:

Players must connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row to win. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
Only one piece is played at a time.
Players can be on the offensive or defensive.
The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate when all forty two slots are filled.
The starter of the previous game goes second in the next game.
The board has 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.

Build a 'create user form' with the fields: Nickname, age. The form will appear in the beginning before the game is played and in case we already have users we will not see the form again (users were already created and saved).

The game will start with a random player.

At the end of the game we will see a popup with the winners name and and two buttons: 'Start a new game' and 'Go to the scoreboard' where we will be able to see the scores of the games.  The score is a counter of how many moves did it take to finish the game.

On the scoreboard we will see the list of playing games with the fields: Winner, counter of moves and duration of the game in minutes and seconds.

During the game we need to be able to see who's turn it is. The app should be built in react technology and typescript. All the other technologies and libraries are up to you. Thinking out of the box and creativity will be very appreciated!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
